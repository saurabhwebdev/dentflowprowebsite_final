        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Journey</h2>
        <p>
          When we launched DentFlow Pro, our mission was clear: create the most intuitive, efficient dental practice management software on the market. We worked closely with dental professionals to understand their unique challenges and built specialized tools to address their needs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Along the way, something unexpected happened. Medical professionals from other specialties began reaching out, asking if our platform could be adapted for their practices. They were drawn to our intuitive interface, streamlined workflows, and the attention to detail that made DentFlow Pro stand out.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why We Expanded</h2>
        <p>
          After careful consideration and extensive research, we realized that the core principles that made DentFlow Pro successful could benefit all clinical practices. The challenges of patient management, scheduling, billing, and operational efficiency are universal across healthcare settings.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Rather than create separate solutions for each medical specialty, we saw an opportunity to build a unified platform that could be tailored to the specific needs of different practices.
        </p>
